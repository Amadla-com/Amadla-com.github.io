For All Your Applications (``apps.d``)
======================================

``apps.d`` contains all the applications configurations that are needed
to get them to be installed via container, directly on the machine, and
X11 applications.

Each applications needs settings, the sources for the code or binaries,
documentation, etc.

The application directory is pulled from a ``git`` repository.

Every version needs a **git tag**. It is important to use **git tags**
for the version because of Amadla support tools and to use the **git
branches** for development whilst using `Gitflow
Workflow <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>`__.

Using tags:

.. code:: bash

   git tag -a v0.1
   git push --tags

All the applications that you want to install need to be listed in the
``/etc/`` directory ``.ini`` files.

In those ``.ini`` you have a clear format on how to add a new
application.

The IaC tools will read these files and add or update or remove the
applications based on the configurations.

You can find many application repository: `Amadla
repository <https://github.com/Amadla-com>`__.

   The version is of the configuration for Amadla not of the application
   itself. Used to select the right tag in the git server.

The ```applications.yml`` <../etc/applications.yml>`__ contains the
default configurations for applications but you can always have other
settings in the ```servers.yml`` <../etc/servers.yml>`__ file.

Here is an example where you have a specific version inside the servers
configuration ``yml`` file.

.. code:: yaml

   servers:
     - name: apps-1
       type: classic
       cloud: linode
       instance-type: small-1gb
       private: true
       applications:
         OpenVPN:
           version: 2
