CI/CD
=========

`CI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`__/`CD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery>`__
tools that Amadla supports: - `GitHub
Workflow <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows>`__ -
`Jenkins <https://www.jenkins.io/>`__

You can use any other CI/CD tools that you whish but for the moments
those are the only ones that Amadla will maintain.

CI/CD helps to quickly put everything together and deploy the things
that you want automatically.

With GitHub Workflow you will be able to just
`fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`__
this repo and then whenever you make a change to the code, and you
commit and push the GitHub Workflow will execute the IaC code and deploy
everything without the need of any other actions on your part.

   More documentation to come.
